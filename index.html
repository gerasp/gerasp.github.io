                    <p class="desc">
                        Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and
                        designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let
                        application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can
                        run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications
                        are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of
                        the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has
                        fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

                        for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but
                        there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition)
                        platform. Although the framework does not impose any specific programming model, it has become
                        popular in the Java community as an addition to, or even replacement for the Enterprise
                        JavaBeans (EJB) model. The Spring Framework is open source.

                        tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance,
                        with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google.
                        Android has been the best-selling OS worldwide on smartphones since 2011 and on tablets since
                        2013. As of May 2017, it has over two billion monthly active users, the largest installed base
                        of any operating system.
